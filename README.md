# Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer repository! This project, developed in June 2024 as a self-initiated project, provides an interactive platform to visualize various sorting algorithms. Explore the efficiency and complexity of different sorting techniques through this engaging tool.

## Project Overview
The Sorting Visualizer showcases the following six algorithms:

 “*” Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Users can select array datasets ranging from 10 to 150 elements and observe how different algorithms sort these arrays in real-time. The visualizer also dynamically calculates and displays the space and time complexity of each algorithm, providing valuable insights into their efficiency.

## Features:
Interactive Visualizations: Watch as the sorting algorithms work through the data, providing a clear visual representation of each step.
Real-Time Complexity Calculation: Get immediate feedback on the time and space complexity of the selected sorting algorithm.
Wide Range of Data Sets: Test sorting algorithms on arrays of various sizes, from 10 to 150 elements.
Deployment
